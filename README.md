Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 solutions repository! 🎄✨

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place every December. Each day, a new coding puzzle is released, challenging participants to solve problems using their favorite programming languages. It's a great way to improve your problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, and have fun with the global developer community.

## Project Description
This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges. Each task is organized by day, and you will find source code, explanations, and any relevant notes for each puzzle. The main goal of this project is to:

- Practice and improve my coding skills
- Explore different problem-solving techniques
- Document my thought process and solutions
- Share my progress with others

Feel free to browse the code, suggest improvements, or discuss alternative approaches!

## Structure
- Each day's solution is located in its own folder (e.g., `task-1/`, `task-2/`, ...).
- Source code is written in Rust.
- Additional files may include input data, notes, and explanations.

## How to Run
To run a specific day's solution:

1. Navigate to the corresponding folder (e.g., `task-1/`).
2. Use Cargo to build and run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## License
This project is open source and available under the MIT License.
